### 1.1. Integer and int() function

> #### **_Integers are zero, positive or negative whole numbers without a fractional part and having unlimited precisionintegers are zero, positive or negative whole numbers without a fractional part and having unlimited precision_**

All integer literals or variables are objects of the int class.  

_**Example 1:**_

```python
# Those are integers
integer_one = 2
integer_two = 8974
integer_three = -894
```

Leading zeros in non-zero integers are not allowed e.g. 000123 is invalid number, 0000 is 0.  

_**Example 2:**_

```python
x=012
SyntaxError:leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted
```

Python does not allow comma as number delimiter. Use underscore _ as a delimiter instead.  

_**Example 3:**_

```python
number_1 = 123_456_789
number_2 = 123456789
number_1 = number_2
```

> #### **_Int() function returns an integer from a given object or converts a number in a given base to a decimal._**

_**Example 1:**_

```python
# Convert a string "5.5" into an integer
num = int("5.5")
print(type(num))
```

_**Example 2:**_

```python
# Convert an input value string class into an integer class
num = int(input("Type in a number: "))
print(type(num))
```

_**Example 3:**_

```python
num = input("Type in a number: ")
num_as_int = int(num)
print(type(num_as_int))
```

### 1.2. Float and float() function

> #### **_The float type in Python represents the floating point number._**

Float is used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. 

_**Example:**_

```python
# Those are float numbers
float_num_1 = 2.5
float_num_2 = 0.777
float_num_3 = -3.87
```

> #### **_Float() function converts a number stored in a string or integer into a floating point number, or a number with a decimal point. _**

_**Example 1:**_

```python
# Convert a string "8.5" into an integer
num = float("8.5")
print(type(num))
```

_**Example 2:**_

```python
# Convert an input value string class into a float class
num = float(input("Type in a number: "))
print(type(num))
```

_**Example 3:**_

```python
num = input("Type in a number: ")
num_as_float = float(num)
print(type(num_as_float))
```

### 1.3. Boolean  

> #### **_\n is a type of escape character that will create a new line when used._**

```python
print("Hello World.\nThis is my first code.\nI live in Helsinki.")
```

### 1.4. Type() function

> #### **_The (+) operator (or addition operator) lets you combine two or more strings._**
  
The addition operator (+) is referred to as the Python string concatenation operator.  
The operator should appear between the two strings you want to merge.  
Don't forget to add space between words in the sentence.

_**Solution 1:** adding space at the end of the first word inside the brackets_

```python
print("Hello " + "World")
```

_**Solution 2:** adding space at the beginning of the second word inside the brackets_

```python
print("Hello" + " World")
```

_**Solution 3:** adding space between the words using space inside a new pair of brackets_

```python
print("Hello" + " " + "World")
```

### 1.5. Arithmetic operators

> #### **_The input() function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns that._**

The function is a way of asking the user to provide some type of input.
When the input function is called it stops the program and waits for the userâ€™s input. 
When the user presses enter, the program resumes and returns what the user typed. 

_**Example 1:**_

```python
input('Enter your name: ')
```
_**Example 2:**_

```python
print(input('Enter your name: '))
```

### 1.6. Round() function

> #### **_The len() function return the length (the number of items) of an object._**

The function is a way of asking the user to provide some type of input.
When the input function is called it stops the program and waits for the userâ€™s input. 
When the user presses enter, the program resumes and returns what the user typed. 

_**Example 1:**_

```python
len('Markus')
```
_**Example 2:**_

```python
print(len('Markus'))

```

### 1.7. Day projects

#### Bootcamp day project: Tip calculator

```python
# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
# Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

print("Welcom to the tip calculator.")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip_persentage = int(input("What persentage tip would you lake to give? 10, 12 or 15? "))
number_of_people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
tip_sum = tip_persentage * bill / 100
pay_sum = bill + tip_sum / number_of_people
sum_for_each = round((pay_sum / number_of_people),2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${sum_for_each}")
````

#### My day project: Service price calculator

```python
# The calculator calculates the cost of the service based on the input data.
# It is assumed that the apartment always has at least 1 window and a door. No zero values are used.

print("Calculate the price for our service.")
square = float(input("How many sq.meters in your apartment: "))
windows = int(input("How many windows in your apartment: "))
doors = int(input("How many doors in your apartment: "))
pets = int(input("Do you have pats in the apartment? If no type in '0', if you have type in '1': "))
price_base = 15

# Calculating a cost based on the input and multiplying on indexes if applicable
price_on_square = price_base * square
price_on_windows = price_base * windows * 1.4
price_on_doors = price_base * doors * 1.2
price_on_pets = price_base * pets * 20
price = price_on_square + price_on_windows + price_on_doors + price_on_pets

# Calculating a cost based on the start date of the service
price_urgent = price * 1.3
print(f"Total price for cleaning service is:\nWe start tomorrow or later: {price}\nWe start today: {price_urgent}")
print("Call us now and get 10% discount!")
````
