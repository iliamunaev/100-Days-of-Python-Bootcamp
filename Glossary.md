# Python Glossary

### Definition of Terms are used in the 100 Days of Python Bootcamp

> ## A

### Addition operator +
The Addition operator + combines two or more strings.  

### and
'and' is logical operator: True if both the operands are true

### Arithmetic operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.  
Arithmetic operators are:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (**)
- Modulo (%)

> ## B

### Boolean
Boolean means a result that can only have one of two possible values: true or false.  

> ## C

### Comparison operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.  
Comparison operators are:
- **Greater than** (>) 
- **Less than** (<) 
- **Greater than or equal to** (>=)
- **Less than or equal to** (<=)
- **Equal** (==)
- **Not equal** (!=)

### Conditional statements
Conditional statements perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specific Boolean constraint evaluates to true or false.

### Count()
Count() function returns the number of occurrences of a substring in the given string.

> ## E

### Escape character
Escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

> ## F

### Float()
Float() function converts a number stored in a string or integer into a floating point number, or a number with a decimal point.  

> ## I

### if statement
if statementis used for decision-making operations. It contains a body of code which runs only when the condition given in the if statement is true

### if-else statement
if-else statement is used when you have to judge one statement on the basis of other. If one condition goes wrong, then there should be another condition that should justify the statement or logic.

### if-elif-else statement
if-elif-else statement is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition. Meaning, if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks.

### Input()
Input() function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns that.

### Int()
Int() function returns an integer from a given object or converts a number in a given base to a decimal.

### Integers
Integers are zero, positive or negative whole numbers without a fractional part and having unlimited precisionintegers are zero, positive or negative whole numbers without a fractional part and having unlimited precision.  

> ## L

### Len()
Len() function return the length (the number of items) of an object.

### Logical operators 
Logical operators are used on conditional statements (either True or False).  
Logical operators are:
- and
- or
- not

### Lower() 
Lower() function takes no arguments and returns the lowercased strings from the given string by converting each uppercase character to lowercase.

> ## M

### Modulo %
Modulo % returns the remainder of dividing the left hand operand by right hand operand.

> ## N

### \n
\n is a type of escape character that will create a new line when used.

### not
not is logical operator: True if operand is false

>## O
>
### or:  
'or' is logical operator: True if either of the operands is true	

> ## P

### Print()
Print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.

> ## R

### Round()
Round() function returns a floating point number that is a rounded version of the specified number, with the specified number of decimals.  

> ## S

### String
String is an array of characters. The informal view of a string is a sentence.

> ## T

### Type()
Type() function returns the type of the objects/data elements stored in any data type.  

> ## V

### Variable
Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location.
